# FANUC-PPR
Python program to punch 8 bit paper tape over a terminal service via TCP

Mostly copied from NF6X, modified to use a TCP socket and to support the FANUC PPR escape chars

Way too specific to contribute back to him, but handy for anyone in the future who has a PPR and is interested in having network attached paper tape
